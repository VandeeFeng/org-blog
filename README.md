This blog uses the [org-static-blog](https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog) to generate static HTML pages from Org files.

The more i used emacs and org-mode, the more i used to it. 

Thanks to  https://github.com/chenyo-17/org-static-blog , i decided to write my blog with emacs in a simple way.

Stay foolish , Stay simple.
